# Internet by Text Service (ITS)


ITS is a service that allows users to surf the internet using only SMS through our application. The application is currently developped on Android while the server is running on Java.

# New Features!
  - Users can type in an URL in the application
  - Application display a simple view (without css) of a webpage
  - Large website are trim into chunks and sent package by package to optimize the transmission duration
  - all package are compressed before send to reduce the size
  - User can now sign in to their twitter account using the application
  - Sending tweets and viewing user's timeline is also possible

You can also:
  - Jump from one page to another (on page links are clickable)
  - Click on next to receive the sequence of a webpage

### Tech

ITS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Android Studio] - an IDE to develop application on android
* [Intellij IDEA] - an IDE to develop programs on JAVA
* [Jenkins] - automation server to support building, deploying and automating any project.
* [MySql] - sql database server.

The server needs a [usb gsm modem](https://www.amazon.fr/Hsdpa-7-2Mbps-Adaptateur-RÃ©seau-Dongle/dp/B01K5P0WCA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1496396243&sr=8-2&keywords=usb+gsm+dongle) that allows the application to send and receive SMS.

And of course ITS itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

ITS server requires [Java jdk x86](https://nodejs.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) to run.

```sh
$ mvn clean package
```
